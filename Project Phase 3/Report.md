}
```

##Problems Faced##
Replace this text with the explaination of the problems you faced in the project, and how you resolved them. Again you can give each of your problems a heading of level 3.

###Problem 1: I don't know how to Code###
Transfer to yourself to social sciences department. Blah blah blah. This is an example. Replace it with your own problem description and how you resolved it. 
Don't just blindly copy paste this report. This is a sample template file. 

###Problem 2: My Parents forced me for a degree###
If you were not able to convince your parents not to force you for degree and now you are doing it for them then do it with your best effort and not half heartedly. There is no point wasting this time with finding a loop hole here and there and passing courses without actually learning anything.
